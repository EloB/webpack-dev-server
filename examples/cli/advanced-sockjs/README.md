# Advanced SockJS use

You can now extend the functionality of the SockJS with your custom needs.

To run this example, run this command in your console or terminal:

```console
npm run webpack-dev-server -- --advanced-sockjs
```

## What Should Happen

When you visit http://localhost:8080/ then it will automatically send any javascript errors to the webpack-dev-server.

If you have opened http://localhost:8080/devtools and do keystrokes while you have http://localhost:8080/ running you will see your keystrokes on that page.
